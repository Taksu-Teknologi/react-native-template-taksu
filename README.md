# :space_invader: React Native Template Taksu

> React Native template for a quick init project starter.

## :star: Features

- Elegant usage directly within the [React Native CLI](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli)
- Consistent with the default React Native template
- Complete with all common use dependencies development
- More confident with type strong, Typescript support

## :arrow_forward: Usage

```sh
npx react-native init MyApp --template https://gitlab.com/spinroam/internal/react-native-template-taksu.git
```

### Usage with older versions of React Native

See the below table to find out which version of the template to use.

#### React Native <=> Template Version

| React Native | Template |
| ------------ | -------- |
| 0.63         | 1.0.\*   |

### Note on the legacy CLI

There seems to be quite some confusion about the legacy CLI. This template only works with the new CLI. Make sure you have uninstalled the legacy `react-native-cli` first (`npm uninstall -g react-native-cli`), for the below command to work. If you wish to not use `npx`, you can also install the new CLI globally (`npm i -g @react-native-community/cli` or `yarn global add @react-native-community/cli`).
